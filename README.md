Sure! Here's a README file for your Fun Calculator Python code:

# Fun Calculator üéâ

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator**! This simple Python program allows you to perform basic arithmetic operations ‚Äî addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division ‚Äî on two numbers you provide.

## Features

- Supports decimal numbers using `float` inputs üéØ
- Calculates and displays:
  - Sum ‚ûï
  - Difference ‚ûñ
  - Product ‚úñÔ∏è
  - Quotient ‚ûó

## How to Use

1. Run the Python script.
2. When prompted, enter the first number. You can input integers or decimals.
3. Next, enter the second number.
4. The calculator will perform all four operations and display the results.

## Code Overview

- Inputs are taken via `input()` and converted to `float` to handle decimals.
- Operations are done using basic arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`.
- Results are printed with descriptive text for easy understanding.

## Important Notes

- The program assumes the second number is not zero when performing division, so avoid entering zero as the second number to prevent runtime errors.

## Example

```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 15.0
Difference: 5.0
Product: 50.0
Quotient: 2.0
```
